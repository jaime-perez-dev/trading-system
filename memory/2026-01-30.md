## 07:45 PM - Task Priority Recommendation
**Recommended Sequence for Account Setups:**
1. **Neon DB** → Database foundation (fastest to implement)
2. **Dodo Payments** → Payment processing layer  
3. **Vercel** → Frontend deployment (goes live)

**Rationale:** This creates a logical dependency chain from infrastructure to revenue-generating capability. Each step builds on the previous one.

**Impact:** With EdgeSignals already built and tested, we're essentially leaving subscription revenue on the table with each day of delay. The product-market fit is proven with our own trading success.
