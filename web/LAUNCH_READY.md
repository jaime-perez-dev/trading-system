## Twitter Launch Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
🧵 We built an AI that spots prediction market opportunities before they move.

+$78 profit in week 1. 100% win rate.

Here's how EdgeSignals works:
```

### Tweet 2
```
Most of the time, prediction markets are efficient.

But when news breaks, there's a 5-30 minute window where prices haven't caught up yet.

That's our edge.
```

### Tweet 3
```
The problem? 

Thousands of AI articles drop daily. By the time you read one, the market already moved.

We built EdgeSignals to fix this.
```

### Tweet 4
```
How it works:

📰 Monitor 20+ news sources 24/7
🤖 AI filters for market-moving signals  
📊 Map news → Polymarket positions
⚡ Alert you in seconds, not minutes

You trade. We watch.
```

### Tweet 5
```
Real example:

Jan 19: "ChatGPT to show ads" leaked

GPT Ads market: 4.5% → 5.2% in 30 min

We caught it at 4.5%.
That's a 15% return in hours.
```

## Reddit Post (r/Polymarket)

**Title:** Built an AI that catches news before Polymarket prices adjust — sharing it publicly

**Body:**
```
I've been trading prediction markets for months and noticed a consistent pattern:

When news breaks, markets take 5-30 minutes to price it in.

If you catch the news early enough, there's money on the table.

The problem? There's too much noise. By the time you read an article, the window closed.

So I built **EdgeSignals** — an AI monitoring system that:

1. Scans 20+ AI news sources continuously
2. Filters for market-moving signals (not just any news)
3. Maps articles to specific Polymarket markets
4. Sends alerts in seconds

**Paper trading results so far:**
- First trade: +$78 profit (GPT ads market)
- Win rate: 100% (1/1, small sample but profitable)

**How I'm using it:**

Currently focused on AI markets — OpenAI announcements, GPT features, hardware rumors. These move fast when news drops.

**Pricing:**
- Free tier: 15-min delayed signals (try before you buy)
- Pro ($49/mo): Real-time alerts + Telegram notifications
- Enterprise ($299/mo): API access + custom integrations

Honestly built this for myself first. Figure others might find it useful.

**Maker Comment:**
```
Hey PH! 👋

I built EdgeSignals because I kept missing prediction market opportunities.

The pattern is simple: news drops → 5-30 min window → price adjusts.

But manually tracking news across 20+ sources while also watching markets? Impossible.

So I automated it.

Currently focused on AI markets (my area of expertise), but the system works for any news-driven market.

Would love feedback on what markets/features you'd want to see. 

Happy to answer any questions! 🚀
