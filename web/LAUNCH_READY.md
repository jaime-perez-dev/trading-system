## Reddit Post (r/artificial)

**Title:** Built an AI that monitors 50+ AI news sources — alerts you about significant developments

**Body:**
```
Hey r/artificial,

I got tired of missing important AI news. There are 50+ sources publishing daily, and it's impossible to track everything.

So I built EdgeSignals — an AI-powered news monitoring service:

**What it does:**
- Monitors 50+ AI news sources 24/7 (TechCrunch, Verge, official blogs, Twitter, etc.)
- AI filters for significant events
- Analyzes how news impacts information market sentiment (Polymarket, Kalshi)
- Sends real-time alerts via Telegram/email

**Why I built it:**
Staying on top of AI news is a full-time job. I wanted to automate the monitoring so I could focus on the analysis.

I also track how news correlates with sentiment shifts in information markets — fascinating data for research.

**Pricing:**
- Free: Delayed alerts (15 min)
- Pro ($49/mo): Real-time alerts + Telegram
- Enterprise: Full API access

**Disclaimer:** This is a news monitoring and research tool. Not financial advice.

Would love feedback — what AI topics would you want tracked?
