## Content Ideas

### Launch Tweet Thread (Draft)

```
🧵 We built an AI that monitors news and analyzes its impact on information markets.

Here's what we learned tracking AI news for a month:

1/ Information markets like Polymarket and Kalshi reflect collective sentiment about future events.

When news breaks, sentiment shifts — sometimes fast, sometimes slow.

We built EdgeSignals to track these patterns.

2/ The challenge? News is everywhere. 50+ sources publishing daily.

By the time you read an article, the conversation has already moved on.

We built an AI to monitor all of it.

3/ How it works:

📰 We monitor 50+ AI news sources 24/7
🤖 AI identifies significant events
📊 Cross-reference with market sentiment data
🔔 Alert you about relevant developments

4/ Example:

When "ChatGPT to show ads" leaked, related market sentiment shifted 24% in 30 minutes.

Our system caught the news within 3 minutes of publication.

5/ We're launching EdgeSignals:

🆓 Free tier: Delayed alerts
💰 Pro ($49/mo): Real-time alerts
🏢 Enterprise ($299/mo): Full API access

Early users get 50% off first 3 months.

6/ Currently focused on AI industry news:

- Model releases (GPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Company announcements
- Product launches
- Industry developments

Research tool for staying informed.

7/ Why us?

We're researchers ourselves. We built this to solve our own problem.

Staying on top of AI news is a full-time job. We automated it.

Title: Built an AI that monitors 50+ news sources and alerts you about significant AI developments

Hey all,

I've been trying to keep up with AI news and noticed it's basically impossible. There are 50+ sources publishing daily, and by the time I read something, the conversation has moved on.

So I built EdgeSignals — an AI that:
1. Monitors 50+ news sources 24/7
2. Filters for significant AI industry events
3. Analyzes sentiment impact
4. Sends real-time alerts

It's focused on AI news — model releases, company announcements, product launches.

I also cross-reference with information market data (Polymarket, Kalshi) to see how news affects collective sentiment.

Free tier has delayed alerts. Pro ($49/mo) gets real-time notifications.

Would love feedback from this community. What AI topics would you want tracked?

Note: This is a research/news tool, not investment advice.
