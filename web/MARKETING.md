# EdgeSignals Marketing Plan

## Product
**EdgeSignals** — AI-powered prediction market intelligence

### Value Proposition
We monitor AI news 24/7 and alert you when it creates trading opportunities in prediction markets.

**Pain points we solve:**
1. **Info overload** — Thousands of AI news articles daily, impossible to track manually
2. **Speed** — By the time you read the news, markets have already moved
3. **Signal vs noise** — Most news doesn't matter; we filter for tradeable signals
4. **Market analysis** — Connecting news to specific prediction markets is hard

### Target Customers
1. **Prediction market traders** — Active Polymarket/Kalshi users
2. **Degens** — Crypto/trading community that likes asymmetric bets
3. **AI enthusiasts** — People following AI developments who want to monetize their knowledge
4. **Professional traders** — Looking for alternative alpha sources

## Content Ideas

### Launch Tweet Thread (Draft)

```
🧵 We built an AI that finds mispriced prediction markets.

Here's how we made +$78 in paper trading on our first week:

1/ Most prediction markets are efficient. Most of the time.

But when news breaks, there's a window — usually 5-30 minutes — where prices haven't caught up yet.

2/ The problem? News is everywhere. By the time you read an article, the market has already moved.

We built EdgeSignals to solve this.

3/ How it works:

📰 We monitor 20+ AI news sources 24/7
🤖 AI filters for tradeable signals
📊 Cross-reference with Polymarket prices
⚡ Alert you BEFORE the market moves

4/ Example:

Jan 19: "ChatGPT to show ads" leaked
GPT Ads market: 4.5% → 5.2% in 30 min

We caught it. Our users will too.

5/ We're launching EdgeSignals:

🆓 Free tier: Delayed signals
💰 Pro ($49/mo): Real-time alerts + API
🏢 Enterprise ($299/mo): Custom integration

Link: [edgesignals.com]

Early users get 50% off first 3 months.

6/ Currently focused on AI markets:

- GPT releases
- OpenAI IPO
- AI hardware launches
- Anthropic milestones

Expanding to politics, sports, crypto soon.

7/ Why us?

We're traders ourselves. We eat our own cooking.

Every signal we send, we trade on.

Results so far: +$78 realized, 100% win rate.

### Reddit Post (r/Polymarket)

```
Title: Built an AI that monitors news and alerts when it impacts Polymarket prices

Hey all,

I've been trading prediction markets for a few months and noticed a pattern: when news breaks, there's usually a 5-30 minute window before prices adjust.

The problem is finding the news fast enough.

So I built EdgeSignals — an AI that:
1. Monitors 20+ news sources 24/7
2. Filters for market-moving signals
3. Maps news to specific Polymarket markets
4. Sends real-time alerts

Currently focused on AI markets (GPT releases, OpenAI IPO, etc.) but expanding.

Paper trading results: +$78 profit, 100% win rate.

Free tier has delayed signals. Pro ($49/mo) gets real-time alerts.

Would love feedback from this community. What features would you want?
